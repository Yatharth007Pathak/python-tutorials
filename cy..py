Dictionary in python

Dictionaries in Python are a collection of key-value pairs. 
Each key is unique, and it is used to access its corresponding value. 
Dictionaries are mutable, which means we can change them after creation.
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs
They are unordered, mutable(changeable) and don't allow duplicate keys
Since dictionaries are unordered, there is no indexing in a dictionary.
We can create a dictionary by placing key-value pairs inside curly braces {}, separated by commas.


Advantages of Using Dictionaries
Fast Lookups: Dictionaries provide fast lookups by key.
Flexible: They can store a variety of data types, including lists and other dictionaries.
Readable: Keys provide meaningful names for data, improving code readability.

Dictionaries are a powerful and flexible data structure, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.
