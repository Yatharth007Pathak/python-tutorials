'''
Type conversion, also known as type casting, is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.
This is a common operation in programming languages to ensure that operations on variables are performed correctly 
and to prevent errors that can arise from type mismatches. There are two main types of type conversion: implicit and explicit.
