Rules for identifiers:-
Identifiers can be combination of uppercase and lowercase letters,digits or an underscore(_)
So, myVariable, variable_1, variable_for_print all are valid python identifiers
An identifier cannot start with digit. So variable1 is valid, 1variable is not valid
We can't use special symbols like !, #, @, %, $ etc in our identifier
Identifier can be of any length
