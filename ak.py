"""
In Python, a string is represented using either single quotes, double quotes, triple single quotes, 
or triple double quotes. Each of these methods allows for different features and use cases.

Triple single quotes  or triple double quotes  are used for multi-line strings and 
can also contain both single and double quotes without escaping them.
