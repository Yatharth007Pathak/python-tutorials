In Python, functions are fundamental building blocks that allow us to encapsulate code into reusable pieces.
Functions are block of statements that perform a specific task.

Here is a comprehensive guide to understanding and using functions in Python:

1. Defining a Function:- Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses ().
2. Calling a Function:- To execute a function, we call it by its name followed by parentheses.
3. Function Arguments:- Functions can accept parameters, allowing us to pass data to them.
4. Default Arguments:- We can define default values for parameters.
5. Return Values:- Functions can return values using the return statement.
6. Variable Scope:- Variables defined inside a function are local to that function.
7. *args and **kwargs:- Functions can accept a variable number of arguments using *args and **kwargs.
8. Lambda Functions:- Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword.
9. Nested Functions:- Functions can be defined within other functions.
10. Function Annotations:- Function annotations provide a way of associating various parts of a function with arbitrary Python expressions.

Understanding and effectively using functions can greatly enhance the readability and maintainability of our code. 
Functions allow us to break down complex problems into manageable chunks, making it easier to debug and test our code

Functions are of 2 types:-
Built-in-type like print(), len(), type(), range()
user defined functions
