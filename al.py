In Python, keywords are reserved words that have special meaning to the interpreter. 
These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). 
Python keywords are case-sensitive and are always written in lowercase (except for True, False, and None).

There are 35 keywords in python:-
