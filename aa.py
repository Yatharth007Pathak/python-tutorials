"""
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and flexibility. 
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Here are some key aspects of Python:

Key Features
Readability and Simplicity: Python's syntax emphasizes readability, making it easier to write and understand code. 
This simplicity allows developers to focus more on solving problems rather than on language intricacies.
Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier and allows for rapid prototyping and testing.
Dynamic Typing: Python uses dynamic typing, which means variables do not need to be declared with a type, 
and their type can change during runtime.
Extensive Standard Library: Python has a large standard library that provides modules and functions for various tasks, 
such as file I/O, system calls, and web development.
Cross-Platform: Python is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a portable language.
Support for Multiple Paradigms: Python supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming styles, 
allowing developers to choose the best approach for their project.

Python Components
Python Interpreter: The program that executes Python code. It can be run interactively or used to execute scripts.
Python Standard Library: A collection of modules and packages included with Python, providing pre-written code for many common tasks.
Virtual Environments: Tools like venv or virtualenv allow developers to create isolated environments for their Python projects, 
ensuring dependencies are managed separately.

Common Uses
Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask make it easy to develop web applications.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, 
and TensorFlow are widely used in data analysis and machine learning.
Scripting and Automation: Python is often used for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
Software Development: Python is used for developing desktop applications and games, with libraries like Tkinter and Pygame.
Scientific Computing: Python is used in various scientific fields, thanks to libraries like SciPy and SymPy.

In Python, comments are used to explain code and make it more readable. They are not executed by the interpreter. 
There are two types of comments in Python: single-line comments and multi-line comments

Single-line comments start with the hash character # and extend to the end of the line.

Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments like some other languages. 
However, multi-line comments can be created using a series of single-line comments or using triple quotes (single or double). 
Though technically these triple-quoted strings are string literals, 
if they are not assigned to a variable or used in any way, they act as comments.
"""

# This is a single-line comment

'''
This is a multi-line comment
using triple quotes.
It can span multiple lines.

# This is a multi-line comment
